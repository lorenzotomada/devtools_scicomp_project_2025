This repository contains the final project for the course in Development Tools in Scientific Computing.


TO DO:
1) Integrate the new code in the parallel solver
2) Profile runtime and memory usage, saving the results and plotting
3) Runtime vs matrix size comparison (follow in detail the instructions on the course repo)
4) Accuracy vs efficiency
5) Script to run on Ulysses
6) Add missing tests
7) Possibly delete eigenvalues\_np and so on, which I inserted because I thought it was not going to be necessary to compute the eigenvectors, making these wrappers useless
8) Write missing documentation
